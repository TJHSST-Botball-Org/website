# About /img/gallery

These are all the pictures for the `/gallery.html` page.

# How to add photos to gallery.html

Organize images into different sections/years by folders.

The names of the folders will be used as section headings.

The Python 3 script `/img/gallery/generator.py` will automatically generate a
`gallery.html` file. Put this in the root folder, as the `gallery.html` page.

The generator will sort sections by name in descending order.
